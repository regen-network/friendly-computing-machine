    "regen:landStory": "The Pillango Project is a 1,101 hectare landscape rooted in an area that was once the world''s second largest temperate indigenous grassland, the Great Plains of the U.S. Located in Wallace County, Kansas, Pillango resides at an altitude of 1,059m above sea level and receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 508mm. Pillango is situated in an area of the U.S. that has geographic significance due to its location above the Ogallala Aquifer, a vital water source that is rapidly depleting. In its original prairie form, the landscape was a herbaceous grassland rooted with native shortgrass prairie perennials. Over the last ten to fifteen years, the land has been cultivated as dryland corn and wheat. This has led to soil degradation, characterized by diminished carbon and water storage capacity. Despite this, the landscape has produced cropland-worthy yields under low rainfall conditions for multiple years, illustrating the underlying potential of its native soil bed.",

    "regen:landStewardStory": "When Pillango''s owner Will sought to transition his Kansas cropland into climate beneficial production in 2019, he partnered with The Provenance Co (TPC). TPC is led by founders Julie and Leslie, siblings who grew up raising livestock on Kansas land. Julie and Leslie bring their institutional knowledge of regenerative agriculture and on-the-ground management experience to bear on the two biggest challenges properties like Pillango face when transitioning: degraded soil and lack of infrastructure to sustain animal, human and microbial life. Together, Will, Julie, and Leslie have been united in the philosophy that in order to restore life underground, one must simultaneously restore life above ground. TPC began implementing their proprietary land stewardship protocol, Regenerative Rewilding ®, in January of 2021.\n\nIn June of 2020, TPC began to work towards returning both human and animal life to Pillango. Jodi, an experienced farming practitioner raised on the fierce Western Kansas landscape, is the onsite crew leader. Dan, trained as an organic soil specialist, and Roberto, an expert herdsman with 20+ years of ranching experience, oversee livestock movement across Pillango land. Together, Jodi, Dan, and Roberto marry animal impact with soil restoration to rebuild the land''s carbon sequestration stores. The onsite TPC team also includes Dan''s wife, Cole, and their two children.",
